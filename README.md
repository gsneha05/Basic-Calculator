This project is a simple web-based calculator built using HTML and CSS. 
It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. 
The calculator has a user-friendly interface with a numeric keypad and a display screen for showing inputs and results.
This marks my understanding of html,css
